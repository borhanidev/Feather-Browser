# 🌐 Feather Browser – A Simple, Hackable Browser

[![License: MPL-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/)

**Feather Browser** is a basic web browser built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).  
It’s intentionally minimal — the goal is for **you** (the community) to edit, improve, and shape it however you like.

This is a community-driven project. Fork it, break it, rebuild it, and make something amazing.

## 🚀 What It Is

- 🧱 Built with Electron (JavaScript + HTML + CSS)
- 🖥️ Only Available for PC (Windows)
- 🔓 Open source and editable
- ✨ Nothing fancy – just a working browser as a starting point

---

## 💡 Why This Exists

This project is for developers, students, and hobbyists who want to:

- Learn how browsers work
- Build their own custom browser
- Add unique features and UI
- Collaborate with others to make it better

> ⚠️ **This is not a polished product.** It’s a base to build on.

## 🔧 Getting Started
Fork the repository and make sure to download node js and just do `npm run build` and it will generate a folder named `dist` there you will find the exe file and just run the installer and start using it. Or if you want to test it only just do `npm run dev`.
